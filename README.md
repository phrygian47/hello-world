# Overview

As a programmer we all start with a simple line of code that prints "Hello World" onto the console. This software will be an example of this program.

This software will print a string containing "Hello World" onto our console using Python as our programming language of choice.

The purpose of this software is to familiarize ourselves with the basics of Python programming and strings. We will learn how to create a string, and about to print that string to the console using Python.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
